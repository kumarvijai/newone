  Parthiban "Parthi" is an animal rescuer and a café owner in Theog, living with his wife, Sathya, son Siddharth "Siddhu" and daughter Mathi "Chintu". One day, Parthi's friend, Joshy Andrews, a forest ranger, calls him to help tame a spotted hyena threatening the townsfolk. With Siddhu's help, Parthi manages to tranquilise the hyena. He purposely avoids public attention over this incident and adopts the hyena after it calms down.

One night, Parthi and Chintu are at the café when Shanmugham, a dangerous gangster and his men arrive to rob the café. Parthi tries to appease them by giving them money, but one of the gang members makes a move on employee Shruthi. Enraged, Parthi beats up all of them. When one of them attempts to kill Chintu, Parthi guns all of them down without hesitation, but later has an emotional breakdown. Initially arrested, Parthi is released for having committed the murders in self-defense, but his photograph appears in newspapers all over India. One such image is seen by a notorious gangster named Harold Das in Telangana, who informs his elder brother, Antony Das about him.
